It's so bizarre, what an awesome treat to see one on the street. According to Wikipedia their were 8,583 made originally and now they're making them again or at least have been since 2008! I can't imagine the performance being spectacular with a 2,700 pound vehicle equipped with a three speed automatic and 130hp engine. The wikipedia article is awesome: [DeLorean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_DMC-12 "DeLorean"). It's so goofy!
